Based on DrEinsteinium's tWiki mod, WikiSearch is a tModLoader mod that allows you to search the Terraria Wiki for whatever is under the mouse cursor.

* Press Q to search the wiki while hovering over any item, NPC, or tile.
* Now has mod support! Included mods: Thorium, Calamity, Spirit, Fargo's, and Tremor.

Visit the homepage for instructions on registering your own mod.

[Known Issues]
* Some naturally-placed tiles cannot be searched
* Chests open the chest page instead of the individual page

[Credits]
* DrEinsteinium for the original tWiki mod
* DarkLight for suggesting mod support and linking some mod wikis
